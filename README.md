# About the Data:
Red wine, a product of the complex interplay between grape varieties, terroir, and
winemaking techniques, presents a rich tapestry of flavours, aromas, and textures.\

A wine itself includes different features like fixed acidity, volatile acidity, citric acid,
residual sugars, chlorides, free sulphur dioxide, total sulphur dioxide, density, pH,
sulphates, alcohol and quality.
# Objective

The aim of this project is to predict the quality of wine on a scale of 0-10 given a set of
features as inputs.

 We have quality being one of these values:[3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]
